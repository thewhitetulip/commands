This package contains commands made accessible to frontends and plugins. They come in three flavours: [`ApplicationCommand`](https://godoc.org/github.com/limetext/backend#ApplicationCommand)s, [`WindowCommand`](https://godoc.org/github.com/limetext/backend#WindowCommand)s, and [`TextCommand`](https://godoc.org/github.com/limetext/backend#TextCommand)s."

##Brief overview of Commands

You first build a type of the command which you are writing. 

    type (
        // JoinLines removes every new line in the
        // selections and the first new line after
        JoinLines struct {
            backend.DefaultCommand
        }
    )

Each command has a `Run` method which is executed when the command is invoked. Please note that the command needs to be invoked by the frontend for it to work.

    //Run executes the DoSomething command
    func (c *DoSomething) Run(v *backend.View, e *backend.Edit) error {
        //Do something here
    }

Commands need to be registered with the backend via the init function.

    func init() {
        register([]backend.Command{
            &DoSomething{},
        })
    }
